# Project Name
**Smart Campus Service Platform**

# Project Description
Smart Campus Service Platform is a centralized web system for managing campus-related activities digitally instead of using emails or paper forms. The platform allows students, faculty, and administrators to submit and track requests, approvals, and notifications through role-based workflows.  

Instead of covering all campus services, this version focuses on **academic decision workflows**, such as course approvals, faculty policy requests, and administrative processes, making it unique and reducing similarity with common student projects.  

The system is designed as a cloud-based SaaS with a multi-user backend and a responsive web interface. It is developed using agile methodology, with iterative sprints for authentication, individual service modules, and administrative workflow management. This approach ensures clear feedback loops, practical usability, and a well-defined frontend/backend structure.
