# Smart Campus Services Platform - Service-Specific Approval System Implementation

## ✅ Completed Implementation Summary

### Overview
Successfully implemented a sophisticated **service-specific admin approval workflow** where each service (library, dining, etc.) has dedicated staff who can only approve/reject requests for their own service.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Backend Service-Specific Approval System**

#### Database Models (Updated)
- **User Model**: Added `ServiceID` field to link staff members to their service
- **Booking Model**: Added `ApprovedBy` (staff ID) and `ApprovalNotes` (text) fields

#### New Approval Handler (`handlers/approval.go`)
Complete implementation with 4 methods:

1. **GetPendingBookings(staffId)** 
   - Returns all pending bookings for a staff member's service
   - Authorization: Only shows bookings for staff's assigned service
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/approval/staff/:staffId/pending`

2. **GetAllBookingsForService(staffId)**
   - Returns all bookings (pending, approved, rejected) for staff's service
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/approval/staff/:staffId/all`

3. **ApproveBooking(bookingId)**
   - Approves a booking and updates status to "approved"
   - Creates a notification for the student
   - Endpoint: `PUT /api/approval/bookings/:id/approve`

4. **RejectBooking(bookingId)**
   - Rejects a booking with optional notes
   - Updates status to "rejected"
   - Creates notification for the student
   - Endpoint: `PUT /api/approval/bookings/:id/reject`

#### Authentication Updates (`handlers/auth.go`)
- Updated `AuthResponse` struct to include:
  - `role` (student, staff, admin)
  - `serviceId` (which service the staff manages)
  - `phone` (for contact purposes)
- Both Register and Login endpoints now return complete user info including service assignment

#### Database Seeding (`seed.go`)
Added staff account creation:
- Creates library-admin@ufl.edu linked to Main Library service
- Creates library-assistant@ufl.edu linked to Main Library service
- Staff can be replicated for other services (dining, transportation, etc.)
- Prevents duplicate staff account creation on re-runs

#### API Routes (in `main.go`)
```
GET    /api/approval/staff/:staffId/pending      → GetPendingBookings
GET    /api/approval/staff/:staffId/all          → GetAllBookingsForService
PUT    /api/approval/bookings/:id/approve        → ApproveBooking
PUT    /api/approval/bookings/:id/reject         → RejectBooking
```

---

### 2. **Frontend Staff Dashboard**

#### New Staff Dashboard Component (`pages/StaffDashboard.js`)
Complete staff interface with:

**Features:**               
- Displays pending bookings only for their service
- Shows student information (name, email, phone)
- Shows booking details (start time, end time, reason)
- Approve/Reject buttons for each booking
- Modal interface for adding notes when approving/rejecting
- Auto-fetches pending bookings on load
- Logout functionality

**Key Methods:**
- `fetchPendingBookings()`: Loads pending bookings for logged-in staff
- `handleApprove()`: Opens modal to approve with optional notes
- `handleReject()`: Opens modal to reject with required/optional notes
- `submitAction()`: Submits approval/rejection to backend
- `formatDate()`: Formats timestamps for display

**State Management:**
- `bookings`: Array of pending bookings
- `selectedBooking`: Currently selected booking for approval/rejection
- `actionType`: 'approve' or 'reject'
- `notes`: Additional notes for the action
- `staffInfo`: Logged-in staff member details
- `loading`, `error`: UI state management

#### Staff Dashboard Styling (`styles/StaffDashboard.css`)
Professional design with:
- Purple gradient header matching brand
- Responsive grid layout for booking cards
- Hover effects and animations
- Modal dialog for approval/rejection
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
- Smooth transitions and visual feedback

#### Navigation Updates (`components/Navbar.js`)
- Added conditional rendering for staff vs. student links
- Staff see "Staff Dashboard" link instead of "My Bookings"
- "Profile" link hidden for staff (only visible for students)
- Role-based navigation based on `user.role`

#### App Routes Update (`src/App.js`)
- New route: `/dashboard/staff` → StaffDashboard component
- Protected route redirects to login if user not authenticated

---

### 3. **Authentication & Authorization**

#### Role-Based Access Control
- **Students**: Can book services, view their bookings, leave reviews
- **Staff**: Can view and approve/reject bookings for their assigned service
- **Admin**: (Infrastructure in place for future implementation)

#### Service-Specific Authorization
- Staff can ONLY see and approve/reject bookings for their assigned service
- Backend validates `serviceId` matches staff's `ServiceID` before allowing approval
- Cross-service approval is prevented by authorization logic

#### Login Flow
1. User logs in with email/password
2. Backend returns user data including `role` and `serviceId` (if staff)
3. Frontend routes based on role:
   - Staff → `/dashboard/staff`
   - Student → `/ ` or `/services`

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Test Data Created
✅ Staff Accounts:
- Email: `library-admin@ufl.edu`, Password: `library123`
- Email: `library-assistant@ufl.edu`, Password: `library123`

✅ Test Student:
- Email: `testuser@ufl.edu`, Password: `test123`

✅ Test Booking:
- Student: Test User
- Service: Main Library
- Status: Pending
- Time: 2026-02-04 10:00-12:00 UTC

### API Testing Results
✅ GET /api/approval/staff/{staffId}/pending - Returns pending bookings ✓
✅ Staff can only see their service's bookings ✓
✅ Auth response includes serviceId ✓
✅ Database correctly links staff to services ✓

### Frontend Testing
✅ Frontend successfully loads at `http://localhost:3000`
✅ Navigation properly shows staff vs. student menus
✅ StaffDashboard component properly imports and renders

## 📊 Database Relationships

```
Staff Member (User)
    ↓ has ServiceID
    Service
    ↑
    has many Bookings
    ↑
    has User (Student)

Booking Flow:
1. Student creates booking → Status: "pending"
2. Staff views pending bookings for their service
3. Staff approves/rejects → Status: "approved" or "rejected"
4. Notification created for student
5. Student sees approval status in "My Bookings"
```
